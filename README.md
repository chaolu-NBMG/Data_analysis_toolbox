## [CSV_combiner_tool](https://github.com/chaolu-NBMG/Data_analysis_toolbox/blob/main/tools/CSV_Combiner_Tool.ipynb)
This script consolidates multiple CSV files within a single directory into one CSV file, while preserving their structure and headers. If the files are spread across different directories or have varied structures, modifications to the script will be necessary.
## [time_series_data_cleaning](https://github.com/chaolu-NBMG/Data_analysis_toolbox/blob/main/tools/time_series_data_cleaning.ipynb)
This notebook cleans a time series dataset with irregular entries that disrupt the expected 5-minute recording intervals, such as unexpected timestamps at 11:56 or xx:02. These inconsistencies can affect subsequent data analysis and forecasting.
